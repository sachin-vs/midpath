      <p>
      You are given a string variable called 'original'. You need to write a
      javascript program that uses this variable and sets the value for another
      variable called 'computed' according to the given rules. 
      </p>
      <p>If the character is a digit, leave it unchanged. If the position of
      the character is a multiple of 3 then rotate the character by 5. If the
      position of the character is a multiple of 5, rotate it by 9. However, if
      the character's position is a multiple of both 3 and 5, rotate it by 3.
      If none of these conditions are satisfied, rotate the character by 2.
      </p>
      <p>
      In order to rotate a character, say 'k' by an amount of 4 we need to find
      the character 4 places before 'k' in alphabetical order which turns out
      to be 'g'. Consider only lowercase a-z characters and assume that they
      are cyclic in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
      When you have written your program, click on 'Run program' button and the
      link below will update. If your program is correct, clicking on it will
      take you to the next step in the hiring process.
      </p>
      <p>If the program is wrong, you will be taken to a 404 page on github.</p>
